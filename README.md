# impermanence-nixos_config
Configs that attempt to use the concept of impermanence within the NixOS ecosystem (or maybe not, who knows?).
Please do not attempt to take inspiration from, or attempt to copy any portion of these configuration files, I promise disappointment will be the only thing you find.
Instead, take inspiration from [Guekka's NixOS as a server, part 1: Impermanence](https://guekka.github.io/nixos-server-1/ "NixOS as a server, part 1: Impermanence")
who also has some more great links at the top of the linked page.

Bottom line: please don't use any of this, don't let my pain, anguish, and despair become yours as well.
